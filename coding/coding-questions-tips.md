1. **Communicate** - It's important to communicate your thought process and approach to solving the problem with your interviewer. This can help them understand how you are thinking about the problem and can also help them give you hints or guidance if you get stuck.
2. **Look for any unused information** - Did your interviewer tell you that the array was sorted? How can you leverage that information?
3. **Use a fresh example** - Sometimes,just seeing a different example will unclog your mind or help you see a pattern in the problem.
4. **Solve it "incorrectly:** - Just like having an inefficient solution canhel you find an efficient solution,having an incorrect solution might help you find a correct solution.
5. **Make time vs. space tradeoff** - Sometimes storing extra state about the problem can help you optimize the runtime.
6. **Precompute information** - Is there a way that you can reorganize the data (sorting, etc.) or compute some values upfront that will help save time in the long run?
7. **Use a hashtable.** - Hashtables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.
8. **Mind the runtime** - always mind the runtime of your solutions. it's improtant for interview itself and could also hint you if you are int he right direction
9. **Review the problem after the interview** - After the interview is over, take some time to reflect on the problem and how you approached it. Did you come up with a solution that you are happy with? Is there anything you would do differently next time? This can help you learn from your experiences and improve your problem-solving skills.
