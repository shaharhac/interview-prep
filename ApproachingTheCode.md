# How do I approach a coding algorythm question ?

## How to prepare ?

1. Try to solve the problem on your own. Hints are provided at the back of this book, but push yourself to develop a solution with as little help as possible. Many questions are designed to be tough-that's okay! When you're solving a problem, make sure to think about the space and time efficiency.

2. Write the code on paper. Coding on a computer offers luxuries such as syntax highlighting, code compleÂ­ tion, and quick debugging. Coding on paper does not. Get used to this-and to how slow it is to write and edit code-by coding on paper.

3. Test your code-on paper. This means testing the general cases, base cases, error cases, and so on. You'll need to do this during your interview, so it's best to practice this in advance.

4. Type your paper code as-is into a computer. You will probably make a bunch of mistakes. Start a list of all the errors you make so that you can keep these in mind during the actual interview.
