# How do I approach a coding algorythm question ?

## How to prepare ?

1. Try to solve the problem on your own. Hints are provided at the back of this book, but push yourself to develop a solution with as little help as possible. Many questions are designed to be tough-that's okay! When you're solving a problem, make sure to think about the space and time efficiency.

2. Write the code on paper. Coding on a computer offers luxuries such as syntax highlighting, code compleÂ­ tion, and quick debugging. Coding on paper does not. Get used to this-and to how slow it is to write and edit code-by coding on paper.

3. Test your code-on paper. This means testing the general cases, base cases, error cases, and so on. You'll need to do this during your interview, so it's best to practice this in advance.

4. Type your paper code as-is into a computer. You will probably make a bunch of mistakes. Start a list of all the errors you make so that you can keep these in mind during the actual interview.


### Optomization
Once you have a brute force algorithm, you should work on optimizing it. A few techniques that work well are:
1. Look for any unused information. Did your interviewer tell you that the array was sorted?How can you leverage that information?
2. Use a fresh example.Sometimes,just seeing a different example will unclog your mind or help you see a pattern in the problem.
3. Solve it "incorrectly:'Just like having an inefficient solution canhel you find an efficient solution,having an incorrect solution might help you find a correct solution. 
4. Make time vs. space tradeoff. Sometimes storing extra state about the problem can help you optimiz:e the runtime.
5. Precompute information. Is there a way that you can reorganiz:e the data (sorting, etc.) or compute some values upfront that will help save time in the long run?
6. Use a hashtable.Hashtables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.
7. Think about the best conceivable runtime
