A closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. The inner function will have access to the variables (and parametres) in the outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.

To use a closure, we need to define a function inside another function and "expose" it - to "expose" a function, return it or pass to another function.

### Example

```
function makeAdder(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

var add5 = makeAdder(5);
var add10 = makeAdder(10);

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add10(2)); // 12
```
In this example, we have defined a function makeAdder(x), that takes a single argument x, and returns a new function. The function it returns takes a single argument y, and returns the sum of x and y.

### Data Privacy
Closures can be useful to create private variables inside a function. the private variables are only in the outer function, and one can reach the data only from the inner function

```
function makeCounter() {
    let counter = 0;
    function inc() {
        return ++counter
    }
    function dec() {
        return --counter
    }
    function print(){
        console.log(counter)
    }
    return {inc,dec,print}
}

let counter1 = makeCounter();
let counter2 = makeCoutner();

counter1.inc()
counter1.inc()
counter1.inc()

counter2.dec()
counter2.dec()

coutner1.print() // logs 3
coutner2.print() // logs -2
```
