## Caching

caching will enable you to make vasly better use of the resources you already have as well as making otherwise unattainable product requirements feasible.
Caches take advantage of the locality of reference principle: ***recently requested data is likely to be requested agian***.

They are used in almost every layer of computing: hardware, os, web browsers, web applications and more.
A cache is like short-term memory: it has limited amount of space, but it typically faster than the original data source and contains the most recently accessed items.
Caches can exist at all level in architecture, but are often found at the level nearest to the front end where they are implemnted to return data quickly without taxing downstream levels.
